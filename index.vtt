00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:08.195
[audio playing...]

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.920
To say that Ukraine provoked a war with

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.770
Russia is like blaming a woman for being

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.950
raped because she wore red lipstick. And

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.230
I keep pushing this question, whose

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.960
fault is the invasion? The Unreal

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.200
answer, I guess is that anger will

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.430
destroy my soul, spoil my personality. I

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.440
am asked to be friendly and feel empathy

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.770
to all humanity, to love all to sit at a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
round table with Russians. But if the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.230
robber came to your house, and someone

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.530
tells you feel empathy, as he rapes or

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.680
kills or tortures your children, how

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.470
would this make you feel? Those from

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.690
colonial countries feel empathy for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.760
Russian soldiers, because they have the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
same issues. Bombs do not fall by

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.370
themselves, and armies are not made up

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.520
for only their leaders. It is why one of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.465
the most important ideas to speak about

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.890
is the power in each individual to take

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.770
responsibility to stop sabotaging the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.170
harmony of the world to stop

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.995
imperialistic States taking down others

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.140
simply because they want control. So

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
yes, we have anger on our side. But is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.080
this worse than those with absolute

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
indifference on theirs? with fear and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.290
anger, we have a right to live our own

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.410
lives. If you want me to end with a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.460
positive statement, then it's this. I'm

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.770
fiercely grateful for our Ukrainian

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.860
armed forces. People like the Metro

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.225
Kusuma insky, a theatre and filmmaker

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.020
who tells us his story through signal

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.270
messages, because he is now a soldier on

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.480
the frontline. Dimitra was always a

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.660
warrior of art, always clear with his

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.540
political statements. So when the full

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.790
scale invasion started, he simply

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.255
changed his tools.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.200
And I can say this because we are very

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.690
close. But I literally feel like he's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.030
protecting me that he's making it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.100
possible to continue my fights using

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:28.925
arts.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.140
I spent all my childhood and youth in

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.245
Crimea.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.245
It is my second home.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.130
It is a place of strength, which

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.770
developed my character and defined my

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.025
existence.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.330
Crimea was taken away by the Russian

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.050
Federation in 2014. And I can no longer

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.945
go there.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.640
It is the main factor. Why join the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.430
armed forces of Ukraine to liberate

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.515
Crimea, and to get home.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.580
On the frontline, it is a completely

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.625
different life.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.020
And what each person feels here is

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.065
completely different.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.585
Everything depends on the location,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.440
there was a time when I was in position

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.765
zero, the closest age of the frontline

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.440
there are your life is under constant

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.100
fire, shooting at orcs, bullets fly by

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.695
you.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.760
Your everyday existence is reduced to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.120
zero. Time behaves in changes in a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.540
completely different way. At most, you

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.840
just have time to sleep in 10 days, you

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.540
can eat three times. And that's it.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.395
Pleasure is a dream. Just doing

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.390
now I'm a signal operator responsible

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.365
for communication to our brigade.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.520
The organization of a military unit and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.640
the completion of basic tests are very

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.440
similar at the theater or film

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.250
production. There is unity, structure

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.015
and management of the team.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.560
I tell the guys that the only difference

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.420
is that there is more responsibility as

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.425
a director, which is very strange,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.780
because war concerns people's lives. But

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.950
sometimes such problems exist. As signal

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.550
operators. We make employees sold their

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.830
scalp tweets, and so on. We carry load,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.220
fill tanks with skill to rip out. Fill

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.990
again. Drag Moon rag down, repair cars

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.260
filled with fuel repair cars again, make

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.110
radio sets put antennas up, put antennas

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.960
down, fill this fuel requirements down.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.780
We repair it, we repair the wheels, we

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.300
repair the car again, put antenna it's

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.480
up and down. After 10 hours or 20 hours

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.970
we remove, move again and instead

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.660
The game. This is an ongoing story, if

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.210
not one task than the other, if not the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.330
third than the first, you will hear

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.625
today, in this moment of life.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.780
Being a soldier gives me an even greater

00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:18.485
understanding of one's own psychology.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.020
And once existence once been, and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.810
oneself. Of course, I have changed

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.600
completely. But I don't know yet how

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.390
been a soldier influences me as an

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.895
artist.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.985
I guess this will resonate later.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.370
Culture is a weapon. It is our sword

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.795
that we carry, and with which we fight.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.640
It is our own individuality, that keeps

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.755
going for hundreds and 1000s of years.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.970
We should work even more on cultural

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.775
weapons, on bullet words, tank sounds,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.935
too developing Ukrainian culture,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.650
cannons that sing this combination will

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.720
create a completely different dimension

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.275
of our existence.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:13.955
Somehow, I want to tell it all beauty

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.560
of course, I'm against war against

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.260
killing. But we are currently on the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.005
defensive. We defend ourselves.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.585
For what

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.690
for our culture to exist, for us to

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.070
exist for our nation to exist for our

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.220
children to exist, so they know that

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.045
they are Ukrainians.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.950
So I want to say that I am here in the

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.770
ranks of the armed forces. Because we

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.735
must be here, we must defend our culture

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.720
we must protect.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:07:16.985
[audio playing...]

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.445
Fortunately, I'm sure.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.600
And then, we need to rebuild the

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.255
language

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.380
to break the link between a candle and a

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.155
trench

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.580
to allow him to regrow its feathers.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.970
Instead of being used to label drones to

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.875
quell the fiery anger of the flowers,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.390
Carnation peony, blue bottle and

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.660
occasion. The deadly weapons with wetek

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.225
needs

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.650
to restore the basement as the Haven.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.100
Plus with Jamsil sprouting potatoes. The

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.020
greatest challenge is to rebuild the

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.480
language. Because even with all the

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.480
windows in place, there will still be

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.630
nothing more than empty frames on the

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.550
freshly painted wall and it's nothing

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.525
but there is no idols in place.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.920
Even as we lay carpets, our clothes will

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.780
revolve around the sturdiness of the

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.245
floors beneath.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.160
There was stripped our homes down to

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.410
their skeletons, these holes build away

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.260
our skin, as if to make it easy to

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.390
discern if our hearts are still beating

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.615
underneath

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.250
their heartbeats and we calm down

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.500
normally. This is now the meaning of the

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.310
word calm.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.900
But will we be able to hear the word so

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.360
that occupies the long arm to the teeth

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.465
do not spill out of it?

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.620
Will we be able to reconstruct the word

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.170
comradeship so that it does not stick in

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.945
the throat?

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.620
And even if these words remaining the

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.470
field, useless and dull, like burn out

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.005
enemy tanks, should we grieve for them?

00:08:54.030 --> 00:09:08.735
Don't we already have enough grief?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.070
Across the centuries of Russian invasion

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.920
and occupation in Ukraine, 1000s of

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.715
artists have faced brutal censorship,

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.865
torture, and imprisonment.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.020
You'll never know all their names or how

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.780
many people have been killed. So we'll

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.540
leave each person who has listened with

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.769
the name of one artist to remember

00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:52.595
